               To reduce the burden, we sign an agreement with the employer, to which they will be remitting employeesâ€™ 
               accrued gratuity on a monthly basis. CPF manages the gratuity for your employees by investing the same and
                ensures adequate financial resources are available to pay them when their term ends. Employees stand to benefit
                 twofold; from the interest earned over their contract period, and from the tax benefit realizable by having their
                  funds invested through a registered Pension Funds Administrator.
